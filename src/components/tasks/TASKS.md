# Welcome

As a part of the Citadel Ministry of Education and Labor's Career Advancement Program, alongside your assigned career we will be giving you several tasks to complete to ensure that you are a valuable contributor to the Citadel and its interest. 

With each task you will be evaluated on a series of qualities denoted as valuable in the workforce. These evaluations will not be used for administrative punishment and are of no consequence. Please answer all questions as honestly as possible.

Please remember to complete your tasks.
